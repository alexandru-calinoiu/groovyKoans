// Groovy introduces the GroovyTestCase for testing. We are using it as the base class for our unit tests.
// Docs for GroovyTestCase can be found at: http://groovy.codehaus.org/api/groovy/util/GroovyTestCase.html

// Groovy can be used solely with Java syntax. You have full control over what facet of Groovy you want.

// Let's start. First - Groovy requires much less boilerplate code. For example, in Groovy we don't
// have to use semicolons at all. As a matter of fact, we don't always need to define the type of the variable!
boolean assertion = false
def hello = "Hola"

// Assign our variables the required values to continue...
// ------------ START EDITING HERE ----------------------
//hello = "Hello"
//assertion = true
// ------------ STOP EDITING HERE  ----------------------

assert assertion, 'Assign "true" to the "assertion" variable to proceed'
assert hello == "Hello", 'Modify "Hola" to "Hello" to proceed'
