// Groovy allows you to use either regular quotes (') or double-quotes (") for String declarations.
// The difference is that double-quotes create a GString, which is a super-powered String.
// For docs about GStrings, see http://groovy.codehaus.org/Strings+and+GString#StringsandGString-GStrings

// GStrings allow you to use the ${} syntax within them. The ${} can contain any valid Groovy expression.
def name = 'George'
def greeting = "Hello ${name}, how are you?" // 'Hello George, how are you?
def math = "The result of 4 + 4 is ${4 + 4}" // 'The result of 4 + 4 is 8'

// Create the target string with the ${} mechanism. Remember that ${} can contain method calls too!
String result
// ------------ START EDITING HERE ----------------------
//result = "The size of the string '${greeting}' is ${greeting.size()}"
// ------------ STOP EDITING HERE  ----------------------

assert result == "The size of the string 'Hello George, how are you?' is 26"
